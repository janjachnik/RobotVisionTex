  abstract = {Particle filters (PFs) are powerful samplingbased inference/learning
	algorithms for dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). They allow us to
	treat, in a principled way, any type of probability distribution,
	nonlinearity and non-stationarity. They have appeared in several
	fields under such names as ?condensation?, ?sequential Monte Carlo?
	and ?survival of the fittest?. In this paper, we show how we can
	exploit the structure of the DBN to increase the efficiency of particle
	filtering, using a technique known as Rao- Blackwellisation. Essentially,
	this samples some of the variables, and marginalizes out the rest
	exactly, using the Kalman filter, HMM filter, junction tree algorithm,
	or any other finite dimensional optimal filter. We show that Rao-
	Blackwellised particle filters (RBPFs) lead to more accurate estimates
	than standard PFs. We demonstrate RBPFs on two problems, namely non-stationary
	online regression with radial basis function networks and robot localization
	and map building. We also discuss other potential application areas
	and provide references to some finite dimensional optimal filters.},

	simulation from posterior distributions. These methods are of particular
	interest in Bayesian filtering for discrete dynamic models that are
	typically nonlinear and non-Gaussian. A general importance sampling
	framework is developped that unifies many of the methods which have
	been proposed over the last few decades in several different scientific
	disciplines. Novel extensions to the existing methods are also proposed.
	We show in particular how to incorporate local linearisation methods
	to those which have previously been employed in the deterministic
	filtering literature; these lead to very effective importance distributions.
	Furthermore we describe a method which uses Rao-Blackellisation in
	order to take advantage of the analytic structure present in some
	important classes of state-space models. In a final section we develop
	algorithms for prediction, smothing and evaluation of the likelihood
	in dynamic models.},

	consists of a Rao-Blackwellized particle ﬁlter with a 3D evidence
	grid map representation. We describe a procedure for dynamically
	adjusting the number of particles to provide real-time performance.
	We also describe how we adjust the particle ﬁlter prediction step
	to accommodate sen- sor degradation or failure. We present an efﬁcient
	oc- tree data structure which makes it feasible to maintain the hundreds
	of maps needed by the particle ﬁlter to ac- curately model large
	environments. This octree structure can exploit spatial locality
	and temporal shared ances- try between particles to reduce the processing
	and stor- age requirements. To test our SLAM method, we utilize data
	collected with manually-deployed sonar mapping vehicles in the Wakulla
	Springs cave system in Florida and the Sistema Zacat´ n in Mexico,
	as well as data collected by the DEPTHX vehicle in the test tank
	at the Austin Applied Research Laboratory. We demonstrate our mapping

  abstract = {In nature, flying insects are capable of surprisingly good navigation,
	despite the small size and relative simplicity of their brains. Recent
	experimental research in biology has uncovered a number of different
	ways in which insects use cues derived from optical flow for navigational
	purposes, such as obstacle avoidance, safe landing and dead-reckoning.
	Inspired by the visual navigation of flying insects, this paper presents
	a model of vision-based navigation using Elementary Motion Detectors
	(EMDs). The performance tests with an autonomous flying robot successfully
	demonstrate goal-directed navigation in an unstructured environment,
	as well as obstacle avoidance and course stabilization behaviors.
	Further investigation in the simulation shows that goal-directed
	navigation can be potentially achieved by simple visual processing,
	and that the design flexibility of this approach leads to high adaptivity
	to the given task-environment.},

	has the advantage over traditional grid based methods that in- complete
	and topological world model information can be utilised. Furthermore,
	the method generates movement commands for the platform to enhance
	the gathering of in- formation for the pose estimation process. Extensive

	with much less computational overhead. In practice, however, a tradeoff
	typically needs to be made between estimation accuracy and computational
	cost.We describe a number of techniques that span the range of tradeoffs
	from maximum computational efficiency with straight CI to maximum
	estimation efficiency with the maintenance of all correlation information.
	We present a set of examples illustrating benefits of CI-based SLAM.},

  title = {Simultaneous Localization and Mapping in 3D Environnements with Stereovision},
  school = {Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse},
  year = {2004},
  abstract = {In robotics, the problems of environment modelling and localisation
	are intimately tied together, and must therefore be solved in a unified
	manner. Over the past 15 years, there has been several contributions
	to this simultaneous localisation and mapping problem (often referred
	to as ?SLAM?), in which landmarks in the environment are both mapped
	by the robot and used to estimate its position. The achievement of
	SLAM encompasses various processes: landmark detection and matching
	from subsequent positions, errors identification of the landmark
	position estimate from a given position, and finally the use of an
	estimation theory is required to estimate both the robot and landmarks
	positions. In this thesis, we tackle the SLAM problem for robots
	evolving in 3D in large environments, without any prior knowledge
	on the environment, and using stereovision. A full implementation
	of the various processes has been conceived, developed, and experimented
	in various contexts. The first part of the thesis deals with the
	data association problem: it introduces a matching algorithm for
	invariant image point features, which is robust to image noise and
	viewpoint changes. To establish points matches, the algorithm mixes
	the image signal information at a given point with geometric constraints
	between the considered point and neighbouring points. Experimental
	results show that the algorithm is versatile, in the sense that it
	can establish reliable matches in almost any kind of scene. The second
	part of the thesis is devoted to the development of a SLAM approach
	using an extended Kalman filter. Landmarks are the point features
	detected in the image, their 3D coordinate being computed by stereovision.
	A full SLAM implementation is depicted, in which the matching algorithm
	is used for both the motion estimation of the robot (Kalman filter
	prediction stage) and the observation of the landmarks. The determination
	of the various errors involved in the whole process (motion estimation
	errors, stereovision errors, landmark observation errors) is depicted
	in details. A way to select the landmarks to be memorised among the
	numerous point features is presented. The last part of the thesis
	presents and analyses results obtained in various contexts: with
	several hundreds meter long trajectories achieved by a low altitude
	flying blimp, with an outdoor rover and with a robot evolving indoor.
	When the trajectory ?closes a loop?, a fast backward correction of
	the robot poses based on the local motion estimates and the landmark
	map is applied, in order to be able to construct spatially consistent
	large digital elevation maps of the environment.},

	the region labels and the image pixel intensities, subject to a
	
	constraint on the total length of the region boundaries.We assume
	
	that the probability densities associated with the image pixel
	
	intensities within each region are completely unknown a priori,
	
	and we formulate the problem based on nonparametric density
	
	estimates. Due to the nonparametric structure, our method does
	
	not require the image regions to have a particular type of probability
	
	distribution and does not require the extraction and use
	
	of a particular statistic. We solve the information-theoretic optimization
	
	problem by deriving the associated gradient flows and
	
	applying curve evolution techniques. We use level-set methods to
	
	implement the resulting evolution. The experimental results based
	
	on both synthetic and real images demonstrate that the proposed
	
	technique can solve a variety of challenging image segmentation
	
	problems. Futhermore, our method, which does not require any
	
	training, performs as good as methods based on training.},

	small, low-cost fixed wing unmanned air vehicles (UAV) or more complicated
	unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) to be a feasible solution in many
	scientific, civil and military applications. Cameras can be mounted
	on-board of the unmanned vehicles for the purpose of scientific data
	gathering, surveillance for law enforcement and homeland security,
	as well as to provide visual information to detect and avoid imminent
	collisions for autonomous navigation. However, most current computer
	vision algorithms are highly complex computationally and usually
	constitute the bottleneck of the guidance and control loop. In this
	paper, we present a novel computer vision algorithm for collision
	detection and time-to-impact calculation based on feature density
	distribution (FDD) analysis. It does not require accurate feature
	extraction, tracking, or estimation of focus of expansion (FOE).
	Under a few reasonable assumptions, by calculating the expansion
	rate of the FDD in space, time-to-impact can be accurately estimated.
	A sequence of monocular images is studied, and different features
	are used simultaneously in FDD analysis to show that our algorithm
	can achieve a fairly good accuracy in collision detection. In this
	paper we also discuss reactive path planning and trajectory generation
	techniques that can be accomplished without violating the velocity

  abstract = {In many 3D object-detection and pose-estimation problems, run-time
	performance is of critical importance.
	
	However, there usually is time to train the system, which we will
	show to be very useful. Assuming that several
	
	registered images of the target object are available, we developed
	a keypoint-based approach that is effective in
	
	this context by formulating wide-baseline matching of keypoints extracted
	from the input images to those found
	
	in the model images as a classication problem. This shifts much of
	the computational burden to a training phase,
	
	without sacricing recognition performance. As a result, the resulting
	algorithm is robust, accurate, and fast-enough
	
	for frame-rate performance.
	
	This reduction in run-time computational complexity is our rst contribution.
	Our second contribution is to
	
	show that, in this context, a simple and fast keypoint detector sufces
	to support detection and tracking even under
	
	large perspective and scale variations. While earlier methods require
	a detector that can be expected to produce
	
	very repeatable results in general, which usually is very time-consuming,
	we simply nd the most repeatable object
	
	keypoints for the specic target object during the training phase.
	
	We have incorporated these ideas into a real-time system that detects
	planar, non-planar, and deformable objects.
	
	It then estimates the pose of the rigid ones and the deformations
	of the others.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new map specifically designed for robots operating
	in large environments and possibly in higher dimensions. We call
	this map the hierarchical atlas because it is a multilevel and multiresolution
	representation. For this paper, the hierarchical atlas has two levels:
	at the highest level there is a topological map that organizes the
	free space into submaps at the lower level. The lower-level submaps
	are simply a collection of features. The hierarchical atlas allows
	us to perform calculations and run estimation techniques, such as
	Kalman filtering, in local areas without having to correlate and
	associate data for the entire map. This provides a means to explore
	and map large environments in the presence of uncertainty with a
	process named hierarchical simultaneous localization and mapping.
	As well as organizing information of the free space, the map also
	induces well-defined sensor-based control laws and a provably complete
	policy to explore unknown regions. The resulting map is also useful
	for other tasks such as navigation, obstacle avoidance, and global
	localization. Experimental results},

	medical image registration is proposed, using a basic concept
	
	from information theory, mutual information (MI), or relative
	
	entropy, as a new matching criterion. The method presented
	
	in this paper applies MI to measure the statistical dependence
	
	or information redundancy between the image intensities of
	
	corresponding voxels in both images, which is assumed to be
	
	maximal if the images are geometrically aligned. Maximization
	
	of MI is a very general and powerful criterion, because no
	
	assumptions are made regarding the nature of this dependence
	
	and no limiting constraints are imposed on the image content
	
	of the modalities involved. The accuracy of the MI criterion
	
	is validated for rigid body registration of computed tomography
	
	(CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and photon emission
	
	tomography (PET) images by comparison with the stereotactic
	
	registration solution, while robustness is evaluated with respect
	
	to implementation issues, such as interpolation and optimization,
	
	and image content, including partial overlap and image degradation.
	
	Our results demonstrate that subvoxel accuracy with
	
	respect to the stereotactic reference solution can be achieved
	
	completely automatically and without any prior segmentation,
	
	feature extraction, or other preprocessing steps which makes this
	
	method very well suited for clinical applications.},

	that usually are dense, complex and cluttered. The proposal is a
	method called the Obstacle-Restriction. At each iteration of the
	control cycle, this method addresses the obstacle avoidance in two
	steps. First there is procedure to compute instantaneous subgoals
	in the obstacle structure (obtained by the sensors). The second step
	associates a motion restriction to each obstacle, which are managed
	next to compute the most promising motion direction. The advantage
	of this technique is that it avoids common limitations of previous
	obstacle avoidance methods, improving their navigation performance
	in difficult scenarios. Furthermore, we obtain similar results to
	the recent methods that achieve navigation in troublesome scenarios.
	However, the new method improves their behavior in open spaces. The
	performance of this method is illustrated with experimental results
	obtained with a robotic wheelchair vehicle.},

  year = {2006},
  abstract = {We address the 3D navigation problem for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
	(UAV) through urban environments, specifically an autonomous robotic
	helicopter. In doing so, we investigate techniques which would allow
	a UAV to perform two kinds of navigation: safe wandering and path
	planning based on a partially accurate world model, with dynamic
	replanning as unmodeled obstacles are detected. Typically UAVs operate
	at high altitudes where obstacle avoidance is not needed. This limits
	the applications they can be used for. A UAV capable of safe wandering
	through an urban environment could perform tasks such as exploration,
	mapping and Urban Search and Rescue. To perform safe wandering, the
	UAV would need to detect and avoid obstacles in real-time. Having
	the ability to plan a path through an urban environment would allow
	a UAV to perform tasks such as package delivery, surveillance and
	patrolling. In developing these capabilities, we address obstacle
	avoidance, path planning, replanning, and system integration with
	a real helicopter. Although obstacle avoidance and path planning
	are well studied problems for ground-based robots operating in 2D,
	they are not well studied for integrated 3D problems such as the
	one proposed in this thesis. We present a novel vision-based obstacle
	avoidance technique combining optic flow and stereo vision. Through
	experiments we show that this combined technique produces more reliable
	safe wandering than either technique alone. Experiments on the real
	autonomous helicopter show that optic flow can be used to avoid obstacles
	to the side, and that stereo vision can be used to avoid obstacles
	to the front. We investigate a number of factors that influence the
	performance of the optic flow-based centering response, including
	optimum camera angle, egomotion compensation, and control strategies.
	Through analytical and empirical investigations, we show the optimum
	camera angle is 45 degrees. We address the path planning problem
	by implementing a Probabilistic Roadmap pathplanner, and assume a
	partially accurate 3D model of the environment is available (implying
	the need for dynamic replanning). We show 3D path planning in a simulation
	environment, including dynamic replanning when unmodeled obstacles
	are detected using stereo vision.},

  abstract = {Bayes filtering techniques have been successfully used for a variety
	of tasks, for instance to navigate a robot through a museum [27]
	or to track diverse objects [10]. Many of these probabilistic search
	techniques are based on Markov and Monte-Carlo methods and allow
	the robust tracking of multiple hypotheses. The basis of every Bayes-based
	filtering technique is its likelihood model. For vision based based
	tracking, it computes for an image and for each vector in the state
	space the probability that the image could have occurred in that
	state. We here explore the possibility of using the distribution
	of pixel color as the only criteria to compute the image likelihood.
	Thus, we circumvent the need for classical image processing methods
	such as color classification, segmentation, or landmark detection.
	Instead, a sketch of the expected image is generated for each pose
	using a simplified version of a voxel-based rendering technique.
	Based on Gaussian models of the different colors in RoboCup, the
	robot?s pose could be evaluated by looking at the current camera
	image. Experiments show that the metric is robust to translation,
	but very sensitive to the orientation dimension. A Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain
	(MCMC) approach is used to integrate and track the robot pose distribution
	over time. The implications of the properties of the likelihood model
	for the particle filter will be discussed and in addition a more
	robust, conventional landmark-based metric will be suggested.},

  abstract = {Within the context of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping ({SLAM}),
	“loop closing” is the task of deciding whether or not a vehicle has,
	after an excursion of arbitrary length, returned to a previously
	visited area. Reliable loop closing is both essential and hard. It
	is without doubt one of the greatest impediments to long term, robust
	SLAM. This paper illustrates how visual features, used in conjunction
	with scanning laser data, can be used to a great advantage. We use
	the notion of visual saliency to focus the selection of suitable
	(affine invariant) image-feature descriptors for storage in a database.
	When queried with a recently taken image the database returns the
	capture time of matching images. This time information is used to
	discover loop closing events. Crucially this is achieved independently
	of estimated map and vehicle location. We integrate the above technique
	into a SLAM algorithm using delayed vehicle states and scan matching
	to form interpose geometric constraints. We present initial results
	using this system to close loops (around 100m) in an indoor environment.},

	To this end we develop and optimize a nearest neighbour classifier
	architecture, which is evaluated on a very challenging database of
	flower images. The flower categories are chosen to be indistinguishable
	on colour alone (for example), and have considerable variation in
	shape, scale, and viewpoint. We demonstrate that by developing a
	visual vocabulary that explicitly represents the various aspects
	(colour, shape, and texture) that distinguish one flower from another,
	we can overcome the ambiguities that exist between flower categories.
	The novelty lies in the vocabulary used for each aspect, and how
	these vocabularies are combined into a final classifier. The various
	stages of the classifier (vocabulary selection and combination) are
	each optimized on a validation set. Results are presented on a dataset
	of 1360 images consisting of 17 flower species. It is shown that
	excellent performance can be achieved, far surpassing standard baseline
	algorithms using (for example) colour cues alone.},

	Point features are matched between pairs of frames and linked into
	image trajectories at video rate. Robust estimates of the camera
	motion are then produced from the feature tracks using a geometric
	hypothesize-and-test architecture. This generates motion estimates
	from visual input alone. No prior knowledge of the scene nor the
	motion is necessary. The visual estimates can also be used in conjunction
	with information from other sources such as GPS, inertia sensors,
	wheel encoders, etc. The pose estimation method has been applied
	successfully to video from aerial, automotive and handheld platforms.
	We focus on results obtained with a stereo-head mounted on an autonomous
	ground vehicle. We give examples of camera trajectories estimated
	in real-time purely from images over previously unseen distances

  abstract = {This article presents foundations, original research and trends in
	the field of object categorization by computer vision methods. The
	research goals in object categorization are to detect objects in
	images and to determine the object’s categories. Categorization aims
	for the recognition of generic classes of objects, and thus has also
	been termed ‘generic object recognition’. This is in contrast to
	the recognition of specific, individual objects. While humans are
	usually better in generic than in specific recognition, categorization
	is much harder to achieve for today’s computer architectures and
	algorithms. Major problems are related to the concept of a ‘visual
	category’, where a successful recognition algorithm has to manage
	large intra-class variabilities versus sometimes marginal inter-class
	differences. It turns out that several techniques which are useful
	for specific recognition can also be adapted to categorization, but
	there are also a number of recent developments in learning, representation
	and detection that are especially tailored to categorization. Recent
	results have established various categorization methods that are
	based on local salient structures in the images. Some of these methods
	use just a ‘bag of keypoints’ model. Others include a certain amount
	of geometric modeling of 2D spatial relations between parts, or ‘constellations’
	of parts. There is now a certain maturity in these approaches and
	they achieve excellent recognition results on rather complex image
	databases. Further work focused on the description of shape and object
	contour for categorization is only just emerging. However, there
	remain a number of important open questions, which also define current
	and future research directions. These issues include localization
	abilities, required supervision, the handling of many categories,
	online and incremental learning, and the use of a ‘visual alphabet’,
	to name a few. These aspects are illustrated by the discussion of
	several current approaches, including our own patch-based system
	and our boundary fragmentmodel. The article closes with a summary
	and a discussion of promising future research directions.},

	classification framework for the semantic annotation of urban
	
	maps as provided by a mobile robot. During the first stage,
	
	local scene properties are considered using a probabilistic bagof-
	
	words classifier. The second stage incorporates contextual
	
	information across a given scene via a Markov Random Field
	
	(MRF). Our approach is driven by data from an onboard camera
	
	and 3D laser scanner and uses a combination of appearancebased
	
	and geometric features. By framing the classification
	
	exercise probabilistically we are able to execute an informationtheoretic
	
	bail-out policy when evaluating appearance-based classconditional
	
	likelihoods. This efficiency, combined with low order
	
	MRFs resulting from our two-stage approach, allows us to
	
	generate scene labels at speeds suitable for online deployment
	
	and use. We demonstrate and analyze the performance of our
	
	technique on data gathered over almost 17 km of track through
	
	a city.},

	is the ability to localize and perform context interpretation.
	
	This is required to perform basic navigation and to facilitate

	this the present paper presents an appearance based method

	The method is robust to variations in illumination and minor
	
	scene changes. The method is evaluated across several different
	
	cameras, changes in time-of-day and weather conditions. The
	
	results clearly demonstrate the value of the approach.},

  abstract = {Loop-closing has long been recognized as a critical issue when building
	maps of large-scale environments from local observations. Topological
	mapping methods abstract the problem of determining the topological
	structure of the environment (i.e., how loops are closed) from the
	problem of determining the metrical layout of places in the map and
	dealing with noisy sensors. A recently developed incremental topological
	mapping algorithm generates all possible topological maps consistent
	with the experienced sequence of actions and observations and the
	topological axioms. These are then ordered by a preference criterion
	such as minimality or probability, to determine the single best map
	for continued planning and exploration. This paper presents the planarity
	constraint and analyzes its impact on the search-tree of all topological
	maps consistent with (non-metrical) exploration experience. Experimental
	studies demonstrate excellent results even in artificial environments
	where loop-closing is particularly difficult due to large amounts
	of perceptual aliasing and structural symmetry.},

  abstract = {The motion of the thorax of the blowfly Calliphora vicina was measured
	during cruising flight inside a cage measuring 40cm´40cm´40 cm. Sensor
	coils mounted on the thorax picked up externally generated magnetic
	fields and yielded measurements of the position and orientation of
	the thorax with a resolution of 1 ms, 0.3 ° and 1mm. Flight velocities
	inside the cage were up to 1.2ms-1, and accelerations were up to
	1 g (Å10ms-2) vertically and 2 g horizontally. During flight, blowflies
	performed a series of short (approximately 20–30 ms) saccade-like
	turns at a rate of approximately 10 s-1. The saccades consisted of
	a succession of rotations around all axes, occurring in a fixed order.
	First, a roll was started. Second, the rolled thorax pitched (pulling
	the nose up) and yawed, resulting in a turn relative to the outside
	world. Finally, the thorax rolled back to a level position. Saccades
	had yaw amplitudes of up to 90 °, but 90 % were smaller than 50 °.
	Maximum angular velocities were 2000 ° s-1, and maximum accelerations
	were 105 ° s-2. The latter correspond to torques consistent with
	the maximal force (2´10-3 N) that can be generated by the flight
	motor as inferred from the maximal linear acceleration. Furthermore,
	the sequence of energy investment in consecutive rotations around
	different axes appears to be optimized during a saccade.},

	direction for each landmark. Experiments show that these visual landmarks
	are robustly matched, robot pose is estimated and a consistent three-dimensional

  abstract = {Images are formed as projections of the three-dimensional world onto
	a two-dimensional light-sensing surface. The brightness of the image
	at each point indicates how much light was absorbed by the surface
	at that spatial position at a particular time (or over some interval
	of time). When an object in the world moves relative to the sensor
	surface, the two-dimensional projection of that object moves within
	the image. The movement of the projection of each point in the world
	is referred to as the image velocity or the motion eld. The estimation
	of the image motion eld is generally assumed to be the rst goal
	of motion processing in machine vision systems. Motion estimation
	is also crucial for compression of image sequences (e.g., the MPEG
	video compression standard uses motion-compensated prediction). There
	is also evidence that this sort of computation is performed by biological
	systems. As an approximation to this, computer vision techniques
	typically compute an estimate of the motion eld known as the optical
	ow. The idea is to measure the apparent motion of local regions of
	the image brightness pattern from one frame to the next. In doing
	this, one is assuming that these intensity patterns are preserved
	from frame to frame. As many authors have pointed out, the optical
	ow f is not always the same as the motion eld v (eg, [1; 2]). There
	are many methods of computing optical ow. The most common are correlation,
	gradient, spatiotemporal ltering, and Fourier phase or energy approaches.
	Although based on somewhat dierent assumptions, these approaches
	are closely related, and can be made identical with proper formulation
	and choice of parameters [3; 4]. Correlation (usually over a local
	window) is by far the most prevalent technique. This is presumably
	due to a combination of intuitive directness and ease of hardware
	implementation. But a recent study by Barron et. al. suggests that
	gradient-based implementations have been the most accurate [5]. In
	addition, the gradient solution is eÆcient (because the solution
	can be computed analytically rather than via optimization), and produces
	sub-pixel displacement estimates. A drawback of the gradient approach
	is that it may only be used for small displacements. But this diÆculty
	can be alleviated using a multiscale coarse-to-ne algorithm. This
	chapter provides a practical description of a Bayesian multi-scale
	gradient-based optical ow estimation algorithm, based on work previously
	published in [6; 4; 7].},

	bees use cues derived from optic flow for navigational purposes.
	The distance flown to a food source is gauged by integrating the
	apparent motion of the visual world that is experienced en route.
	In other words, bees possess a visually driven ‘odometer’ that is
	robust to variations in wind load and energy expenditure. Bees flying
	through a tunnel maintain equidistance to the flanking walls by balancing
	the apparent speeds of the images of the walls. This strategy enables
	them to negotiate narrow passages or to fly between obstacles. The
	speed of flight in a tunnel is controlled by holding constant the
	average image velocity as seen by the two eyes. This avoids potential
	collisions by ensuring that the bee slows down when flying through
	narrow passages. Bees landing on a horizontal surface hold constant
	the image velocity of the surface as they approach it. This automatically
	ensures that flight peed decreases with altitude and is close to
	zero at touchdown. The movement-sensitive mechanisms underlying these
	various behaviours seem to be different, qualitatively as well as
	quantitatively, from those mediating the well-investigated optomotor
	response.},
