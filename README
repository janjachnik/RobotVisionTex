RobotVision .bib file. 

This will live in svn and everyone should check it out once on each of
                  their machines, keep it synchronised and up to date
                  and then make a symbolic link to it from paper directories.

Style notes:

To try to stay consistent, citations strings should have this form:

Single author paper:
Davison:ICCV2005

Two author paper:
Klein:Murray:ISMAR2007

More than two authors:
Angeli:etal:TRO2008

Conference references can be simple like this:

@inproceedings{Chli:Davison:ECCV2008,
        title = "Active Matching",
        author = "M. Chli and A. J. Davison",
        booktitle = ECCV,
        year = 2008
}

In this day and age I don't think there's any need for page numbers,
                  city name, etc. for conferences.

Journal references should include full number, volume, page information:

@article{Civera:etal:IJCV2009,
        title = "Drift-Free Real-Time Mosaicing",
        author = "J. Civera and A. J. Davison and J. A. Magall\'{o}n and J. M. M. Montiel",
        journal = IJCV,
        volume = "81",
        number = "2",
        pages = "128--137",
        year = 2009
}

There are a lot of strings defined just below for all the main
                  conferences and journals so use these to keep the
                  format standard. I like the ones we have here which
                  have the full name as well as the familiar acronym
                  to make them stand out. I think we should phase out
                  the year-specific conference strings because these
                  aren't really necessary any more.


Remember that in bib entries you need to put curly brackets around
                  things you want to stay in capital letters like {3D}
                  or {SLAM}.

There are probably still some entries in the file which aren't
                  consisten with this style but we'll try to iron them
                  out gradually.
